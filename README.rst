dvis
====

customized matplotlib extensions

I have a number of standard matplotlib "hacks", that I keep reinventing over
and over. This "project" is an effort to do these things once -- and
well. The "hacks" that are collected in this repository all build on
matplotlib and are meant to improve on its features for **d** ata
**vis** ualization.

Installation
------------

dvis obviously depends on `matplotlib <http://http://matplotlib.org/>`_.

To install dvis, simply download the sourcecode and type

sudo python setup.py install

After that, you should be able to use dvis.
