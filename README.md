customized matplotlib extensions

I have a number of standard matplotlib "hacks", that I keep reinventing over
and over. This "project" is an effort to do these things once -- and
well. The "hacks" that are collected in this repository all build on
matplotlib and are meant to improve on its features for *d*ata
*vis*ualization.
